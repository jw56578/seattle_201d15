# Class 7: Object-Oriented Programming with Constructor Functions; HTML Tables

<a id="top"></a>
# Today's Plan: Week 2, Tuesday Lecture

#### Rather than spend time doing quiz review, are there any questions on Quiz 3? If so, we'll go over them, and if not, we'll move on to regular class material.

#### Quiz 4 will be published this afternoon and will be due tomorrow (Wednesday) night.

- Announcements
  - Sam might have a meeting this afternoon during the 4:00 hour and might not be present in lab at that time.
  - Tonight, from 6-9, is the Code Fellows Grand (re)Opening Extravaganza. How will this affect lab? Expect there to be more activity and distractions than usual from 5:00 on.
  - At last report, RSVPs for tonight numbered at 200+. But, also note that this event means that Sam will be around and can help through the evening event, so please feel free to stay around and work if you can stay focused.

- [Review of Yesterday](#codereview) *[30-45 minutes]*

- [Constructor functions](#code) *[60 minutes]*

*15-minute break*

- [HTML Tables](#tables) *[45-60 minutes]*

- [Lab overview](#lab) *[30-45 minutes]*

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 7 of Code 201, students will:

- Be able to translate an object literal into a constructor function, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Be able to use the ‘prototype’ property to extend the inheritable properties and methods of a constructor function, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Be able to dynamically build an HTML table with JavaScript and render it to the DOM, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment

## Readings

## Code Review

Rather than go through someone's code this morning, we'll start today with Sam just building out a solution to yesterday. You'll get a lot of insight into process and also into some of the details.

## Constructor Functions

We'll look at how to build constructor functions from object literals and talk about some large-scale design issues relating to this week's project.
