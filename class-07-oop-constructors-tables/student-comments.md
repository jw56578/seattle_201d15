# Student Comments from Week 1

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- Good question, I believe course could be one week longer to reduce amount work on the weekend

- I found everything helpful, but there was some material I was already familiar with, although that doesn't mean it wouldn't be helpful to someone else, or that review isn't good.

- I'm not great at getting information out of the reading.

- Lectures can get a bit long and while I can understand their helpfulness by exposing one to content, sitting and listening to anyone talk about one subject for more than 20 minutes is difficult for me unless they're changing subjects rapidly.

- I wish we had more T.A.'s as their time can get sucked up by other classmates during lab time. I can see how 4 T.A.'s and a teacher for 25 students is already a pretty good staff to student ratio though. Never had to wait more than 10 minutes, and usually I just grab their attention a quick second and they come find me when they're done. Better access to 301's and 401's (student mixers?) might help alleviate this, but their time is also valuable/occupied.

- I found the TAs very helpful and willing to work with you when you are having problems. Some even stay past 5 and 6pm if you still need help.

- During lab when you get help from one TA, and then from another, the way they are solving the problem is different so it's very confusing to understand when your code is constantly being rewritten. I think the TA's need to have a meeting before every lab to all get on the same page as how to solve the problems.

- Least helpful was probably the limited exposure we have had working with CSS.

- Javascript teachings. Feel that teaching loops and showing how logic works could be more easily done by utilizing node.js and stepping through a debugger instead of using the browser console.

- Everything seems to be working just fine so far, I have no complaints at this point.

- Code Fellows 102 set me up well for week 1 of 201, and I suspect for part of week 2. So most of the javascript concepts I already had gone over, but hadn't yet had lab practice with those js concepts. That said, I wish there were a way that 201 followed 102 (and maybe 102 was required was required).

- The lectures seem too long. It's difficult to take in 3 hours of new information without giving us a chance to try it out ourselves.

- It would be good to have a length of time in the middle of the lecture to code a mini-assignment or edit our homework, that way it's easier to digest some of the knowledge before moving on.

- Doing code review is great because it allows us to analyze our work in a different light, but it would be even more productive if some of the time could be spent for us to make our own changes instead of sitting on our hands until after lunch to start.

- Lecture time can sometimes feel a bit unstructured and some topics got covered more quickly than I would like. I really appreciate the live code demos that have been done and would like to see even more of those integrated into the lecture.

- Probably the reading review, but I think I've been taking the reading more seriously than others (based on the discussion assignments). And the pair programming was useful, but since my partner didn't have much to contribute, I had to take the lead, but it was difficult to suggest things rather than just telling.

- I didn't have anything negative about this week, except that I did not know that there would be a substantial amount of reading assignments. I have always had trouble with read and reflect.

- I would say that all aspects of the course were helpful from the readings to the lab assignments.

- I would say that the lecture sessions have been the least helpful. I think they are done well but I just get see more benefit when I am working on things like we do during lab time where it is more hands on.

- No time for questions in class. It's probably me, but I am always playing catch up. So if I didn't get something, I spend a lot of time figuring it out and run out of time for readings. Our class is at all levels but I feel as though I graded the same as the person with programming experience. I think I need a tutor. :)

- I found each day that most everything was helpful. I did have an issue with one of the TA's confusing me instead of helping me, but then I went to a different TA that explained things easily and understood.

- Everything was good

- Honestly, this week has been amazing!

- There was no least helpful aspect from this week. It was Great!

- So far I find all the resources helpful

- Probably the lecture, but at the same time it is necessary.

- I am noticing a small disconnect from class lectures and lab assignments. Almost every lab assignment, I am experiencing big surprises because I have no clue what we are about to code. I am not sure if this is intentional because I also can agree that this method of learning creates an explosive learning curve which in turn helps with faster retention but at the same time this may cause unwanted negative externalities like quick burnout or produce lower quality lab assignments.

- The quizzes do not help at all but if this is the only screening method for advance courses, it is what it is. Lastly, class size is too big for 201. I'm thinking if = (classSize <= 20) { alert 'launch one class with one instructor'} else if { alert 'add another class'}.

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- The hands on approach and direct lessons

- The ability to ask the instructors questions during the lectures is very helpful and the individual help received during the labs are great.

- Lab time is awesome

- the TA's and the instructor

- Love having approachable T.A.'s and Teacher. That's been the biggest asset. Other class members as well. When I get stuck on a problem, it helps to be able to talk out the problem with other folks, get their feedback and restructure my efforts accordingly.

- Code review is awesome to either see your content ripped apart or look at how someone else solved the same problem.

- The most helpful aspect of this course so far has been the code reviews in the morning and the lab time working with other students. Lab is definitely where you learn the most and I love how much you're pushed everyday by new concepts.

- Javascript work and working with GitHub have been amazingly informative.

- Applying the concepts on my own to build something

- Lab time has been nice to sit down and work with fellow students. I like to see example code during classroom time. This is something that was lacking at the university.

- The lab, by far. I'm glad some of the lab work was very difficult. One of the main ways I learn is by failing, trying again, failing again, trying again, and finally getting it. I love that they don't give us all of the answers i, and we have to discover new concepts and details around a new concept.

- Anything involving paired programming and code review. I also like how in the lecture, we're spending some time learning the overall architecture of programming this early on. It helps to give us context for how the computer processes our code.

- I'd really like to get a better idea of how the lower levels work (the compilation process, how machine's read native language, etc.) because as I understand it, the process in .NET is quite a bit different.

- Lab time has been really helpful in reinforcing the topics covered in class. In particular the way in which lab time stacks on itself day after day is helpful because it allows me to improve a learn how to build off what I have already built.

- Lecture: design concepts, good coding practices, semantic html structuring, the in class demonstrations, class questions and the various little tangents, all of lab.

- Nothing out of the ordinary. It's just a usual classroom, we learn and we work.

- The most helpful aspects were definitely the lab assignments. It gave me a great opportunity to collaborate with my classmates to solve problems in my own code.

- The one on one help during the lab sessions. All the TA's are incredibly helpful and the same goes for Sam.

- Lab time and collaboration. The lessons are good too as long as I keep up. Could not do this without the help of TAs and teacher in the lab.

- I thought that the labs were the most helpful this week. They all forced me think differently, and come to a better understanding of how I learn. I learned quickly to ask for help, and to take breaks to let my mind digest everything.

- the most helpful aspect of the course is the functions part.

- The TA's help, even though at times they would explain things slightly differently which would kind of throw me off, their willingness to help was astounding to me.

- The pair coding.

- So far I find all the resources helpful

- Lab time with help from the teacher and ta's.

- Lab assignments and peer code review.

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

- Would like to have a resource to discuss the next levels of the program with so I can decide which 401 class would be the best fit for me.

- I wish there could be more in depth work with HTML and CSS. I doubt it's possible with the amount of time Javascript requires, but I still feel limited with my abilities to work with structure and layout.

- I have a pretty good head start on a lot of my fellow students but I knew that would be the case when I signed up. All in all the pace seems to be good for everyone and it has been helpful for me to get a chance to cover some of this material for a second time. So far, I would rate the instruction ahead of what I received in university computer courses and I'm sure I will have more to say as this course progresses.

- Just the incongruence from 102 to 201. But I also get that going over concepts I learned in 102 will only help me learn the material better. I do think that some of the students who are struggling in 201 would've been helped immensely by taking 102. So far I've been very happy with 201.

- I feel like there is no time to get up to speed if you miss something in class, for instance. I am having trouble this weekend getting my assignment done as we went through the lesson in class very quickly and once you miss just one little thing, you can't follow along with the rest. So I need to research, and research where to research (proper Google search). Then I run out of time.

- I am curious to know if codefellows has some sort of alumni network, or any networking events in the future?

- Maybe that the TAs review the class lab assignment for the day prior to helping us with it just for efficiency sake and for a smaller gap of sharing inaccurate information about the assignment.

- Where can I get one of those code fellows zip up hoodies? haha
