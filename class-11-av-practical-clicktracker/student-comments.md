# Student Comments from Week 2

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

I don't really have anything here. This week was fantastic.

I would say the reading assignments were the least helpful this week because they took up a lot of time we could have spent on

The least helpful aspect this week was the reading. I feel like I did not take enough away from them this week and learned more in lecture.

I didn't have enough time to work on my projects.

Being sick all week wasn't helpful. Everything we did in class was helpful in some way.

**Sam says: This class has been unusually affected by people getting sick.**

Code reviews only seem helpful to the advanced students.

Everything has been helpful.

*There wasn't as much collaboration among students this week as last week. We're getting together for lunch more often and helping each other with little things, but I would like to have more days dedicated to paired programming to force ourselves to analyze each other's code. I understand this puts many people out of their comfort zone, especially when we all have different backgrounds and learn at different paces, but I think it would be really helpful to get us in the habit of asking each other more questions, especially when all the TA's are busy.*

Reading

I would have liked to have had a heads up of where the overall weekly labs are headed so that I could have organized my code in a way that could be adjusted to fit the new daily requirements.

Perhaps there could be an overview of the weekly assignment on Monday that sets the stage for the week with a minimum required steps to complete and everything else would be considered stretch goals.

The lecture sessions are still where I'm not picking up too much. It's a good overview of things but it's a lot to keep track of.

There was a lot of reading to cover early in the week and it took a lot of time. I was hoping the lectures would review some of that material in more depth.

Begrudgingly, we all need css work. Didn't like it, but it's useful. I guess nothing was the least helpful in my mind. Learning bit by bit.

I found the lectures to be a little long this week

It's a bummer that the iOs is only with Apple at this time.

Everything this week was helpful.

The CSS exposure still makes me feel behind when compared to other aspects of the coursework. Though TAs have been giving me additional sites for reference to help better my exposure.

**Sam says: The key parts of this course with respect to readiness for Code 301 is solid JavaScript (which is at the center of 301) and a broad foundation in CSS layout principles. The JS has to come first because you can't survive Code 301 without it. It's expected that CSS kind of simmers.**

Text book reading assignments and turning in our comments on Canvas over these readings.

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

I liked the one on one meetings a lot. Having Adam in to discuss the iOS 401 was very enlightening. I really enjoyed building forms and tables as I will find them very useful for business ventures. Great week!

I think taking a breather on Thursday and just focusing on css was definitely what I needed after the two intense days of JavaScript on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The most helpful aspect this week was when Sam took extra time to show some of us how to build out the lab for the salmon cookie table.

Using javascript to create HTML also using the construction function.

The wireframe exercise. Previous attempts at css had been frustrating.

the TA's and the instructors

Interacting with the instructor and ta's during the lab.

I'm glad we had one-on-one talks with Sam this week, because I got to talk specifically about my own learning path, and what to expect down the road all the way through 401. I also appreciated Adam coming in and telling us about iOS development and the 401 course. I'm hoping we'll get the same kind of thing for Python and JavaScript 401 in the next week.

Code demo and looking over sample code.

I really enjoy the collaborative possibilities of using slack in the development environment. Perhaps some of the early assignments could be designed to be worked on over slack in order to encourage the class to use this tool more often. Sharing and utilizing other peoples code is huge and if we could find a way to get people thinking in those terms, then we may see more cases of slack being used to collaborate.

Lab sessions are still great. The TA's and instructor are really helpful and patient when your not getting something

The lab reviews that were done where Sam worked through the lab from the previous day.

DOM, loops, arrays, constructors, objects, functions.

Help from students and TA's around was most helpful for me.

Code Review this week was very helpful. We have been moving fast, and it has been nice to reflect on what we did the previous day.

The extra time Sam took with some of us with no previous experience to understand the lessons.

The second lecture session on Tuesday was extremely helpful and I felt like that lecture helped solidify my conceptual and procedural understanding of the lessons we learned.

Javascript aid in understanding elements of the work was a huge help. I'm still behind in some aspects but I'm catching up bit by bit.

When Sam did an extra tutorial over the Cookie Stand project.

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

Working on networking skills could be helpful, though maybe that comes at a later date?

**Sam says: It does. The professional development content really kicks in during Code 401.**

Nope!

nope

Some tissues would be nice. And the coffee outlets keep going out!!

**Sam says: I'll be sure to highlight this with our Campus Director. Usually we have more tissues around, but cold/flu season seems to have kicked in a little early this year!**

just be awesome

Nope!

I would suggest taking some time to sketch out our learning path in more detail. It's clear what we are doing on a weekly basis, and we have a good idea of what the final project for 201 will be like, but it would be helpful to know the specific goals of 201 and 301. This includes which frameworks/libraries we will learn and when, and a brief description of what each of them does.

Nope

I would have like to see the wire-framing exercise before we were sent off on our own to design a page (ie about_me & cookie_store).

Design principles might be a good topic to add early on.

 I am seeing lots of Git issues with people, Perhaps we could build some Git exercises using a GitHub repository that contains instructions and steps to follow in order to complete the assignment.

We could be using the products built by each student and each class to be used as templates for assignments in the future. For example we could have an assignment where we must build a wire frame that meets certain requirements and then that collection of wire frames could be used in future classes as a pool of options that students could use to build web pages with more individuality.

Collecting all of our about me pages in one spot could also be used as references or examples for for future classes.

Nope.

None at this time.

Not at this time

I think we need an additional TA for our class because of the class size (at least three day out of the week). Munir was very helpful and patient in solving the core problems we were facing on Thursday. He tends to explain complex concepts with the student's capabilities and knowledge in mind. He would be especially helpful for the next two weeks, and for the upcoming 301 course.

My major concern is still with CSS and javascript -- to a lesser extent. It seems difficult to cram in anything beyond the javascript work that we have been doing in such a short amount of time though.
