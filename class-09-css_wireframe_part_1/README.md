- Announcements
  - We'll start at 9:00 this morning with a visit from Karinne and Mindy of our Admissions team. They'll provide information for you about your next steps and also answer any questions you have.
  - Thursdays noon-1: Office hours with the Admissions team in the front lounge area.
  - This afternoon, in the earlier half of lab time, Sam will do a 5-minutes-or-so one-on-one with each student to converse about your progress and also any questions you might have on the course material, etc. With 25 students, this will take a couple of hours, and we'll get started on them around 1:00. We'll just go in the order that you appear in the "People" page on Canvas.
  - Aliza is out sick again today, and our Special Guest Emergency Stand-In TA is Munir. He'll also beat you at ping-pong, but not as badly as Ruben did.
  - ***DEEP BREATH***....... This kind of is a catch-up day for us, and also the day we leave the most wide-open and with the least amount of new content involved. Why?
  - Adult learning cycle: we need time to reflect.

  - Today we're focused on reviewing and developing a deeper understanding of what we've been building the past three days, and we're shifting our focus for the remainder of the week more to page layout and UI/UX concerns.
  - We know it's been a hard few days, but the class is doing well.
  - It's not to soon to start thinking about final projects. Let's have a brief conversation about that today, because a week from tomorrow you're going to be divided up into teams and starting on your projects.
  - Tomorrow we'll look at some projects from prior classes and talk a bit about what to expect from Project Week.
  - Learning Journal assignments: I apologize for the confusion on those. I finally figured out why they kept showing up even though I thought I deleted them last week. You should only see learning journal assignments on Mon-Wed-Fri going forward.
  - Today is Sam's wife's birthday, and Sam is going to try to get on his way home by about 5:00 or so this afternoon so that he can make dinner for her tonight. TAs will be available to assist through 6:00, as is usual.
